## Overcoming Challenges in PLDP: A New Paradigm for Protecting Privacy Budgets and Enhancing Data Utility


## Codes
- The [attack_SMP](https://github.com/hharcolezi/risks-ldp/tree/main/attack_SMP) folder has the codes for reproducing the attacks to the SMP solution.
- The [attack_RSpFD](https://github.com/hharcolezi/risks-ldp/tree/main/attack_RSpFD) folder has the codes for reproducing the attacks to the RS+FD solution.
- The [countermeasure_RSpRFD](https://github.com/hharcolezi/risks-ldp/tree/main/countermeasure_RSpRFD) folder has the codes for reproducing the experiments/attacks of our countermeasure RS+RFD solution.

## Data
The [datasets](https://github.com/hharcolezi/risks-ldp/tree/main/datasets) folder has the following (pre-processed) datasets.
- [ACSEmployement](https://github.com/zykls/folktables)
- [Adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)

## To Do
- I am slowly cleaning/generalizing the codes + documentation.
- Implement RS+RFD in the [multi-freq-ldpy](https://github.com/hharcolezi/multi-freq-ldpy) package.

## Environment
I mainly used Python 3 with numpy, pandas, numba, multi-freq-ldpy, and ray libaries. The versions I use are listed below:

- Python 3.8.8
- Numpy 1.23.1
- Pandas 1.2.4
- Numba 0.53.1
- Multi-freq-ldpy 0.2.4
- Ray 1.11.0
