## Overcoming Challenges in PLDP: A New Paradigm for Protecting Privacy Budgets and Enhancing Data Utility


## Codes
- In the file [UPRAPPOR](https://github.com/Couchy-wu/PLDP-FEBSF/blob/main/Code/UPRAPPOR.py) there is a Personalized dynamic calibration code based on the implementation of basic-rappor.
- In the file [EMalgorithm](https://github.com/Couchy-wu/PLDP-FEBSF/blob/main/Code/EMalgorithm.py)  there is code for an optimization algorithm based on the implementation of the expectation maximization algorithm
- In the file [UPKRR](https://github.com/Couchy-wu/PLDP-FEBSF/blob/main/Code/UPKRR.py) there is a personalized dynamic correction code based on the implementation of basic-rappor.
- In the file [samplepower](https://github.com/Couchy-wu/PLDP-FEBSF/blob/main/Code/samplepower.py) there is code to generate a power law distribution based on the set of privacy budgets.

## Datasets
The [datasets](https://github.com/Couchy-wu/PLDP-FEBSF/tree/main/Dataset) folder has the following (pre-processed) datasets.
- [Bank](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prakharrathi25/banking-dataset-marketing-targets)
- [Adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)
- [Census](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets.html)

## To Do
- I am slowly cleaning/generalizing the codes + documentation.

## Environment
I mainly used Python 3 with numpy, pandas, numba, multi-freq-ldpy, and ray libaries. The versions I use are listed below:

- Python 3.11
- Numpy 1.26.3
- Pandas 2.2.1
- Scipy 1.12.0
